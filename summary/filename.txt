Emotions and feelings are central to our life. Each person has some degree of control over what they feel and how they express and share their feelings. In this sense, Arnold and Gasson define emotion as "the felt tendency toward an object judged suitable, or away from an object judged unsuitable, reinforced by specific bodily changes according to the type of emotion". Perception must occur before an emotion can arise.
