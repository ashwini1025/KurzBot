Many of my friends and neighbours had pets at their home and I also longed to have one. I often told my mother to get home a pup or a kitten and she always dismissed my wish saying she doesn’t have time to look after it. My father went to the office and my mother was engrossed in the household tasks most of the times. I again requested my parents to get me a pet. Looking at how lonely I had grown ever since my brother had gone to the hostel, they decided to fulfil my wish. My mother serves her lunch at sharp every day. ConclusionJersy has won the heart of all my family members.
