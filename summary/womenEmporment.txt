Playing multiple roles in families, women have already proven their worth, but still their condition on social and economical fronts has not been up to the mark and in many parts of the world they are forced to lead a miserable life. On international level as well, women have successfully created their unbeatable position, but they are just a handful in comparison to their not so fortunate counterparts. Victims of Discrimination: Due to long prevailing gender discrimination and dominance of men in the Indian society, women have been suppressed in their families and society at large. Even they have been prone to violence and various discriminations by the male members, even in their own families. A Long Way to go: In rural areas, the condition of women is far from satisfactory and their contribution to the economy is also negligible. Winds of Change: Though Women have been given a special place in every religion, many ill practices have been going on against women as a norm since ages. At the individual level too, women are now breaking the shackles of suppression and making their voices heard for their rights. The Parliament of India too has passed various legislations to save women from various forms of injustice and discrimination.
