Many of my friends and neighbours had pets at their home and I also longed to have one. I often told my mother to get home a pup or a kitten and she always dismissed my wish saying she doesn’t have time to look after it. I again requested my parents to get me a pet. Looking at how lonely I had grown ever since my brother had gone to the hostel, they decided to fulfil my wish.
