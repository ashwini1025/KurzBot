Introduction

My pet cat, Jersy is a Maine Coon Cat. It is dark brown and black in colour. She is quite active and playful. She spends most of her time with me and is therefore more affectionate towards me than any of my other family member.

Why we brought Home a Pet Cat?

Many of my friends and neighbours had pets at their home and I also longed to have one. I often told my mother to get home a pup or a kitten and she always dismissed my wish saying she doesn’t have time to look after it.

When my brother went to the hostel for higher studies, I felt quite lonely. My father went to the office and my mother was engrossed in the household tasks most of the times. I did not have anyone to play and felt the need of having a pet all the more. I again requested my parents to get me a pet. Looking at how lonely I had grown ever since my brother had gone to the hostel, they decided to fulfil my wish. I was overjoyed at hearing this. It is then that Jersy came into our lives. It has been with us for over four years now.

My Pet Cat is Playful Yet Disciplined

Jersy is extremely fond of playing while at the same time it is also quite well-behaved. Many cats run around the house breaking things. However, Jersy makes sure she does not cause any such damage. She also takes instructions. My mother serves her lunch at sharp every day. Jersy goes and sits near her feeder around the same time every day. She finishes her food and makes sure it does not spill around.
